# Hi there 👋

My name is Angelo Yana, a first-year college student passionate about software development and networking. I've been self-teaching for about two years now, and here you can find some of the projects I've been working on throughout these past years.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

I primarily work with Python 🐍 and JavaScript 🌐, along with some popular frameworks and libraries.
